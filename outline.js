Chapter 2.
            1. Need a variable named boatInventory, the value must be a function. This variable must be in the
                fishingBoat.js module.
            2. This function must return the value of the array when it is invoked.
            3. Create a new module called data.js, that holds the array of fish objects.
            4. The function must import the data from the new module.

Chapter 3.
            1. Import the function that is defined in the fishingBoat.js into the fishMonger.js module. 
            2. Define a new function named mongerInventory (for loop) that iterates thru the data and returns a modified array of objects.
            3. Create a new variable for the chef's price.
            4. In the mongerInventory function, have an if statement that checks if the price is less than or equal to
                7.50, AND if the quantity is equal to or greater than 10. If so, push that object into the empty array.
            5. Create another if statement that checks if the monger array has fish equal to or less than the chef's price.
                If so, push THAT object into an array for the chef inventory.
            6. Export the mongerInventory function.
Chapter 4.
            1. Import and invoke the mongerInventory function into restaurant.js
            2. Define a new function called fishMenu, the argument should be the chef's inventory array(all the fish that met the chefs price requirement).
            3. Create a for loop that iterates the chef's inventory array, and reduces the amount by 50% on each object.( BE PREPARED TO ADJUST FISH MONGER FUNCTION)
            4. Create a variable in our function to store our HTML string.
            5. Iterate the chefs inventory array, and interpolate the name of each fish into the HTML string.
            6. Return the HTML string.
